            <h6> Immersive STEAM Learning - USC CS538 Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality Term Project </h6>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h6> [Unity3D, C#, Oculus Rift, Steam VR] </h6>
                    <p>
                        I worked with 5 other people over the course of the semester to build a VR learning/trivia experience.<br />
                        Using Unity3D, Oculus Rift and the Steam VR plugin, we made a game in which the player roamed a space station one wing at a time, answering questions in a certain topic before moving on.<br />
                        Within each wing is a portal transporting the player to a fantastical location where the player has to use a different motion to select their answers to multiple choice questions in a given category.<br />
                        When the player "wins" the minigame by answering enough questions correctly, they are sent back to the main level where they receive a clue and move on to the next wing.<br /><br />

                        Using C# and available assets, I designed and implemented the "jellyfishing" minigame.<br />
                        The jellyfish were animated within Unity to have a pulsing motion, and given physical properties to float around and swim within an invisible cage that envelops the player, who must use a larger-than-life net to catch the jellyfish whose color matches that of their selected answer.<br />

                        Additionally, I assembled and filled the initial main level, and later assisted in filling the final main level. Additionally, I added interactable objects in each wing of the space station and added code to blend the audio between levels.<br />

            <h6> [Unity3D, Blender, C#] </h6>
            <p>
                TikiMan Go is an app in development via the USC Directed Research program. <br />
                During the semester I worked on it, my assignment was playability, weapons, and villains; introduce enemy projections that harm health <br />
                Using Blender, I added motion to models that UCLA undergraduates were creating.<br />
                It was also my duty to coordinate with the eundergraduate students.<br />
                In taking the game from one with a single enemy to one with different enemies based on level, I restructured the existing code to support enemy objects that used a C# interface allowing different attack, run, and sound per enemy.<br />

                    <h6>[Gmail API, Recaptcha API, Clover Developer Pay API, FB Login API, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, cPanel web hosting]</h6>
                    <p>
                        As a continuation of the final project for CS50xMiami, I built upon code provided for PSET 7 (CS50 Finance website) to deploy a functioning commerce site
                        for The Glass Oven. We later decided to migrate the site to SquareSpace and it is no longer in use. <br /><br />

                        Customers could browse the menu, place orders, and view an order history.<br />
                        The Glass Oven could view an order dashboard.<br />
                        Cart and checkout were highly customized to allow adding of "extras" to cake items, specified ordering quantities for different item types, and day-specific delivery options.<br /><br />

                        PHP was used to load HTML5 pages that read information from a SQL server.<br />
                        Using the Clover API and curl, payments were processed via The Glass Oven's Clover account.<br />
                        Upon purchase, the Gmail API was used to email confirmation to both The Glass Oven and the customer.<br />
                        Recaptcha and Facebook Login were used to help protect the SQL database as well as make login easier for clients.<br />
                        Bootstrap and CSS3 were used to style the website.<br />
                        GoDaddy was used for hosting, providing cPanel managing and allowing the continued use of mySQL and PHPmyadmin which were previously used from thwe CS50 IDE.<br />
